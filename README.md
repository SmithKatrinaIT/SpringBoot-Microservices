# SpringBoot-Microservices

## Project is the result of a Spring Boot tutorial from Instructor Ramesh Fadatare

I've included a lot of comments throughout the classes/microservice logic 
to drive home the concepts outlined in the tutorial.

In order to reflect back on the use of different libraries/dependency code examples, 
I've opted to commented out the replaced code, whereas the instructor will usually 
just completely remove/delete the previous code usage.
